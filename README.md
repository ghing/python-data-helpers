# Data Helpers

Useful functions for working with data in Python/Pandas.

This is a central repository of functions I found myself copying between multiple projects.

It serves as a canonical place for reusable pieces of code, with tests.

## Installation

Even though this is a Python package, It might make sense to copy and paste code from this repository, or vendorize the code, rather than installing this package and adding to a mess of depenencies.

Install using pip:

```
pip install git+ssh://git@@github.com/ghing/python-data-helpers.git#egg=data-helpers
```

## Installation for development

```
pipenv install --dev
```

## Running tests

```
pipenv run python -m pytest
```
